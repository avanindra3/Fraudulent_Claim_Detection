# Fraudulent Claim Detection
Developing a predictive model for insurance fraud detection offers significant business value. Fraudinvestigations currently rely on manual processes like reviewing claims, calling claimants, and conductingbackground checks, which are time-consuming and inefficient.

These delays allow fraud to goundetected while legitimate claims face unnecessary scrutiny.  Predictive modelling enables earlyidentification of high-risk claims, streamlining fraud investigations, reducing financial losses, andimproving operational efficiency.

It also enhances customer experience by expediting legitimateclaims. Ultimately, an effective fraud detection model leads to better decision-making, optimisedresource allocation, and increased profitability.The objective is to build a model to classify insurance claims as either fraudulent or legitimate basedon historical claim details and customer profiles. By using features like claim amounts, customerprofiles, claim types, and approval times, the company aims to predict which claims are likely to befraudulent before they are approved.
